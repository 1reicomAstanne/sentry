# Sentry ðŸ¤–  

Starts your crystal application and watches files and restarts on file changes

## Installation

To install in you project, from the root directory of your project, run:
```bash
curl -fsSLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samueleaton/sentry/master/install.rb | ruby
```

This install script is just a convenience. If it does not work, simply place the file located at `src/sentry.cr` into a your project at `dev/sentry.cr`.

## Usage

Assuming `sentry.cr` was correctly placed in `[your project name]/dev/sentry.cr`, simply run (from the root directory of your app):

```bash
crystal dev/sentry.cr
```

You can override the `build` and `run` commands by setting the `BUILD` and `RUN` environment variables, respectively:

```bash
BUILD="crystal build src/my_app.cr" RUN="POSTGRES_USER=postgres ./my_app"
```
